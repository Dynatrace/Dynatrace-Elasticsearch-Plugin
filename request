hello,

I have a request for the ES fastpack you are developing. Is there a way you can create measures for different indices (like index name, doc count, delete count, health, status, pri, rep, store size, etc..)
The below command will pull those values:
curl -XGET http://chdd-es01.cps.local:9200/_cat/indices?v

That way we can create a dashbord for index health. The dashboard can have tables for each measure (doc count, delete count, health, etc..) 

For ex: We can have a dashlet table for measure 'document count' which would have splittings by index name.

below is the command to extract doc count for each index:
curl -XGET http://chdd-es01.cps.local:9200/_cat/indices?v | awk "{print $3, $6}"

example output:
index docs.count
unilog_04 99377
cps_documents 495303
customer_alias-20160331 160917
